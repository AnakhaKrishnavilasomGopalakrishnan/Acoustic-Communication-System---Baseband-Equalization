# Acoustic-Communication-System---Baseband-Equalization
To design a data transmission system over an acoustic channel transferring text messages between two units via sound in the air. Part A: 1. Signal encoding/decoding from the bit stream to symbols 2. Conversion to an analogue coding/decoding technique; orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). 3. Transmission channel equalization.
